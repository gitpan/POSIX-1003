=head1 NAME

POSIX::1003::Module - Base of POSIX::1003 components

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   # use the specific extensions
   # and see POSIX::Overview and POSIX::1003

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The POSIX functions and constants are provided via extensions of this
module.  This module itself only facilitates those implementations.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item POSIX::1003::Module-E<gt>B<exampleValue>(NAME)

Returns an example value for the NAMEd variable. Often, this is a
compile-time or runtime constant. For some extensions, like C<::Pathconf>,
that may not be the case.

=item $obj-E<gt>B<import>()

All modules provide a C<:constants> and a C<:functions> tag, sometimes
more.  The default is C<:all>, which means: everthing. You may also
specify C<:none> (of course: nothing).

When the import list is preceeded by C<+1>, the symbols will get published
into the namespace of your caller namespace, not your own namespace.

  use POSIX::1003::Pathconf;
  use POSIX::1003::Pathconf ':all';  # same
  use POSIX::1003 ':pc';             # same, for the lazy
  use POSIX::1003 ':pathconf';       # same, less lazy

  sub MyModule::import(@)   # your own tricky exporter
  {   POSIX::1003::Pathconf->import('+1', @_);
  }
