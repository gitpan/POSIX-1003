=head1 NAME

POSIX::1003::Signals - POSIX using signals

=head1 INHERITANCE

 POSIX::1003::Signals
   is a POSIX::1003::Module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POSIX::1003::Signals qw(:functions SIGPOLL SIGHUP);
  sigaction($signal, $action, $oldaction);
  sigpending($sigset);
  sigprocmask($how, $sigset, $oldsigset)
  sigsuspend($signal_mask);

  kill SIGPOLL//SIGHUP, $$;

  use POSIX::1003::Signals '%signals';
  my $number = $signals{SIGHUP};
  $signals{SIGNEW} = $number;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This manual page explains the access to the POSIX C<sigaction>
functions and its relatives. This module uses two helper objects:
L<POSIX::SigSet|POSIX::SigSet> and L<POSIX::SigAction|POSIX::SigAction>.

See L<documentation in the base class|POSIX::1003::Module/"DESCRIPTION">.
 
=head1 METHODS

=head1 FUNCTIONS

These functions are implemened in POSIX.xs

=head2 Standard POSIX

=over 4

=item B<kill>(SIGNAL, PROCESS)

Simply L<perlfunc/kill>.

B<Be warned> the order of parameters is reversed in the C<kill>
exported by POSIX!

  CORE::kill($signal, $pid);
  ::Signals::kill($signal, $pid);
  POSIX::kill($pid, $signal);

=item B<raise>(SIGNAL)

Send a signal to the executing process.

=item B<sigaction>(SIGNAL, ACTION, [OLDACTION])

Detailed signal management.  The C<signal> must be a number (like SIGHUP),
not a string (like "SIGHUP").  The  C<action> and C<oldaction> arguments
are C<POSIX::SigAction> objects. Returns C<undef> on failure. 

If you use the C<SA_SIGINFO flag>, the signal handler will in addition to
the first argument (the signal name) also receive a second argument: a
hash reference, inside which are the following keys with the following
semantics, as defined by POSIX/SUSv3:

  signo   the signal number
  errno   the error number
  code    if this is zero or less, the signal was sent by
          a user process and the uid and pid make sense,
          otherwise the signal was sent by the kernel

The following are also defined by POSIX/SUSv3, but unfortunately
not very widely implemented:

  pid     the process id generating the signal
  uid     the uid of the process id generating the signal
  status  exit value or signal for SIGCHLD
  band    band event for SIGPOLL

A third argument is also passed to the handler, which contains a copy
of the raw binary contents of the siginfo structure: if a system has
some non-POSIX fields, this third argument is where to unpack() them
from.

Note that not all siginfo values make sense simultaneously (some are
valid only for certain signals, for example), and not all values make
sense from Perl perspective.

=item B<signal>(SIGNAL, (CODE|'IGNORE'|'DEFAULT'))

Set the CODE (subroutine reference) to be called when the SIGNAL appears.
See L<perlvar/%SIG>.

   signal(SIGINT, \&handler);
   $SIG{SIGINT} = \&handler;  # same

=item B<sigpending>(SIGSET)

Examine signals that are blocked and pending.  This uses C<POSIX::SigSet>
objects for the C<sigset> argument.  Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item B<sigprocmask>(HOW, SIGSET, [OLDSIGSET])

Change and/or examine calling process's signal mask.  This uses
C<POSIX::SigSet> objects for the C<sigset> and C<oldsigset> arguments.
Returns C<undef> on failure.

Note that you can't reliably block or unblock a signal from its own signal
handler if you're using safe signals. Other signals can be blocked or
unblocked reliably.

=item B<sigsuspend>(SIGSET)

Install a signal mask and suspend process until signal arrives.
This uses C<POSIX::SigSet> objects for the C<signal_mask> argument.
Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item B<strsignal>(SIGNAL)

Returns a string reprentation of the SIGNAL.  When the SIGNAL is unknown,
a standard string is returned (never undef)
