=head1 NAME

POSIX::1003::FdIO - POSIX handling file descriptors

=head1 INHERITANCE

 POSIX::1003::FdIO
   is a POSIX::1003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POSIX::1003::FdIO;

  $fd = openfd($fn, O_RDWR);
  defined $fd or die $!;   # $fd==0 is valid value! (STDIN)

  $fd = openfd($fn, O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC);
  $fd = openfd($fn, O_CREAT|O_WRONLY, 0640);
  # Permission bit constants in POSIX::1003::FS

  my $buf;
  $bytes_read    = readfd($fd, $buf, BUFSIZ);
  $bytes_written = writefd($fd, $buf, 5);

  $off_t = seekfd($fd, 0, SEEK_SET);  # rewind!
  $fd2   = dupfd($fd);

  closefd($fd) or die $!;

  my ($r, $w) = pipefd();
  writefd($w, "hello", 5);
  readfd($r, $buf, 5);
  closefd($r) && closefd($w) or die $!;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Most people believe that the C<sys*> commands in Perl-Core are not
capable of doing unbuffered IO. For those people, we have this module.
Whether C<sysread()> or L<readfd()|POSIX::1003::FdIO/"Standard POSIX"> is meassurable faster cannot be
answered.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 Overview

Perl defaults to use file-handles avoiding file descriptors. For
that reason, the C<fread> of POSIX is the C<read> of Perl; that's
confusing. The POSIX-in-Core implementation makes you write
C<CORE::read()> and C<POSIX::read()> explicitly. However,
C<POSIX::read()> is the same as C<CORE::sysread()>!

For all people who do not trust the C<sys*> commands (and there are
many), we provide the implementation of POSIX-in-Core with a less
confusing name to avoid accidents.

    POSIX   Perl-Core POSIX.pm POSIX::1003::FdIO
 FH fseek   seek
 FD lseek   sysseek   lseek    seekfd
 FH fopen   open
 FD open    sysopen            openfd   # sysopen is clumpsy
 FD fdopen                              # IO::Handle->new_from_fd
 FH fclose  close
 FD close   close     close    closefd
 FH fread   read
 FD read    sysread   read     readfd
 FH fwrite  write
 FD write   syswrite  write    writefd
 FH         pipe,open                   # buffered unless $|=0
 FD pipe              pipe     pipefd
 FH stat    stat
 FD fstat             fstat    statfd
 FN lstat   lstat
 FH ftell   tell
 FD                            tellfd   # tell on fd not in POSIX
 FH rewind            rewind
 FD                            rewindfd # idem
 FD creat             creat    creatfd
 FD dup                        dupfd

Works on: FH=file handle, FD=file descriptor, FN=file name

=over 4

=item B<closefd>(FD)

Always check the return code: C<undef> on error, cause in C<$!>.
  closefd $fd or die $!;

There is no C<sysclose()> in core, because C<sysopen()> does unbuffered
IO via its perl-style file-handle: when you open with C<CORE::sysopen()>,
you must close with C<CORE::close()>.

=item B<creatfd>(FILENAME, MODE)

Implemented via L<openfd()|POSIX::1003::FdIO/"Standard POSIX">, which is true by definition of POSIX.

=item B<dup2fd>(FD, NEWFD)

Copy file-descriptor FD to an explicit NEWFD number. When already
in use, the file at NEWFD will be closed first.  Returns undef on
failure.

=item B<dupfd>(FD)

Copy the file-descriptor FD into the lowest-numbered unused descriptor.
The new fd is returned, undef on failure.

=item B<openfd>(FILENAME, FLAGS, MODE)

Returned is an integer file descriptor (FD).  Returns C<undef> on
failure (and '0' is a valid FD!)

FLAGS are composed from the C<O_*> constants defined by this module (import
tag C<:mode>) The MODE field combines C<S_I*> constants defined by
L<POSIX::1003::FS|POSIX::1003::FS> (import tag C<:stat>).

=item B<pipefd>()

Returns the reader and writer file descriptors.
  my ($r, $w) = pipefd;
  writefd($w, "hello", 5 );
  readfd($r, $buf, 5 );

=item B<readfd>(FD, SCALAR, [LENGTH])

Read the maximum of LENGTH bytes from FD into the SCALAR. Returned is
the actual number of bytes read.  The value C<-1> tells you there is
an error, reported in C<$!>

B<Be warned> that a returned value smaller than LENGTH does not mean
that the FD has nothing more to offer: the end is reached only when 0
(zero) is returned.  Therefore, this reading is quite inconvenient.
You may want to use POSIX::Util subroutine readfd_all

=item B<seekfd>(FD, OFFSET, WHENCE)

The WHENCE is a C<SEEK_*> constant.

=item B<statfd>(FD)

Request file administration information about an open file. It returns
the same list of values as C<stat> on filenames.

=item B<writefd>(FD, BYTES, [LENGTH])

Attempt to write the first LENGTH bytes of STRING to FD. Returned is
the number of bytes actually written.  You have an error only when C<-1>
is returned.

The number of bytes written can be less than LENGTH without an error
condition: you have to call write again with the remaining bytes.  This
is quite inconvenient. You may want to use POSIX::Util subroutine readfd_all

=head2 Additional

Zillions of Perl programs reimplement these functions. Let's simplify
code.

=over 4

=item B<rewindfd>(FD)

Seek to the beginning of the file

=item B<tellfd>(FD)

Reports the location in the file. This call does not exist (not in POSIX,
nor on other UNIXes), however is a logical counterpart of the C<tell()> on
filenames.

You can limit the import to the C<SEEK_*> constants by explicitly
using the C<:seek> import tag.  Use the C<:mode> for all C<O_*>
constants, to be used with L<openfd()|POSIX::1003::FdIO/"Standard POSIX">.
