=head1 NAME

POSIX::1003::Errno - all error codes defined by the OS

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POSIX::1003::Errno; # load all names

  use POSIX::1003::Errno qw(errno);
  # keys are strings!
  $ticks = errno('EPERM');

  use POSIX::1003::Errno qw(errno EPERM);
  if($!==EPERM) ...

  use POSIX::1003::Errno '%errno';
  my $key = $errno{EPERM};
  $errno{EUNKNOWN} = 1024;
  $ticks  = errno('EUNKNOWN');

  print "$_\n" for keys %errno;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The error codes provided by your operating system.

The code modules Errno and POSIX do also contain an extensive
list of error numbers.  However: Errno have their values hard-coded,
which is incorrect (higher numbered codes may [do!] differ per platform).
POSIX only provides a limited subset.

=head1 METHODS

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 Standard POSIX

=over 4

=item B<sterror>(ERRNO)

Returns the string representations of the ERRNO, as provided by
the operating system.

=back

=head2 Additional

=over 4

=item B<errno>(NAME)

Returns the errno value related to the NAMEd constant.  The NAME
must be a string. C<undef> will be returned when the NAME is not
known by the system.

example: 

  my $ticks = errno('EPERM') || 1000;

=item B<errno_names>()

Returns a list with all known names, unsorted.

=back

=head1 CONSTANTS

=over 4

=item B<%errno>

This exported variable is a tied HASH which maps C<E*> names
on numbers, to be used with the system's C<errno()> function.

=back

The following constants where detected on your system when the
module got installed.  The second column shows the value which
where returned at that time.
